<p>The Magic Caf√© is a popular community for magicians for 20 years. Yet, with the popularity of Facebook groups, subreddits (e.g., <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Magic/">r/Magic</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cardmagic/">r/CardMagic</a>), the old-school design of The Magic Caf√© may turn young magic enthusiasts away from the platform.</p>

<p>Other decline signals include the end of the special guest of honor series, which included sessions with magic icons ranging from Eugene Burger to Darwin Ortiz. The last ‚Äúguest of honor‚Äù was Xavier Spade in 2016 ‚Äî the only guest that year.</p>

<p>From personal experience, I go months without visiting The Magic Caf√©. Yet, even after six months away, catching up is easy. In contrast, keeping up with posts on Reddit is more difficult.</p>

<p>Is the volume of posts decreasing over time? Are there cyclical trends in posting behavior? Are certain areas of magic declining more than others? Is the Magic Caf√© dying? In this post, I examine posting trends over time.</p>

<p>As always, find the code and the data linked below:</p>

<p>There you have it. The number of posts is dropping year after year starting in 2008. Why did it begin declining in 2008? The housing crisis? Competition from other magic communities ranging from Reddit to Theory11? Who knows. That topic is interesting to explore in a future post. Given the drop in the number of posts, it is unsurprising that special guests stopped in 2016. There are other online magic communities (e.g., <a href="https://forums.geniimagazine.com/">Genii Mag azine‚Äôs forum</a>), and many have been around as long as The Magic Caf√©. Therefore, competition may not be the only reason.</p>

<p>So, what does the decline in user activity mean? As an outsider, I can only speculate. The community still has enough activity to continue for a long time. But, given Steve Brook‚Äôs recent <a href="https://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/viewtopic.php?topic=723763">personal crisis</a>, and the fast decline in user activity, the need to document this piece of magic history is essential before it disappears forever. I hope to update The Magic Caf√© Dataset biannually to keep a copy around if anything were to happen.</p>

<h1 id="post-frequency-over-time-by-subforum">Post frequency over time by subforum</h1>

<p>Are all communities declining at similar rates? I find that the distribution (shape) of the decline varies subforum-to-subforum. For instance, has the mentalism subforum (Penny for your thoughts) combated the max exodus better than the card magic subforum (The workers)? See the figures below:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/is-the-magic-cafe-dying/workers-time.png" alt="The Magic Cafe" width="500" /></p>

<p>‚ÄúThe workers‚Äù (card magic) subforum‚Äôs decline started in 2004, much earlier than the overall decline of the Caf√© (which began in 2008). This finding is intriguing. I tried to look at posts around that time to see what happened but could not gather anything quickly. Did the moderation methods change? Did the forum become saturated such that searching for old posts replaced the need to post new ones? I don‚Äôt know.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/is-the-magic-cafe-dying/mental-time.png" alt="The Magic Cafe" width="500" /></p>

<p>The shape of the decline for the mentalism subforum is much different from card magic. The decline better matches the overall distribution, with a drop in posts starting in 2007.</p>

<p>The ‚ÄúTricky Business‚Äù subforum (which ‚Äútalk(s) about the business side of magic‚Äù) also declined over time. It did see a substantial resurgence in 2011 (which also appeared for the previous two communities, albeit much smaller). But, now averages only a few posts each day.</p>

<p>Okay Okay Okay‚Ä¶ Enough with the apocalyptic study about the end of The Magic Caf√©. The plots below show a couple interesting trends.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/is-the-magic-cafe-dying/magiccafe-days.png" alt="The Magic Cafe" width="500" /></p>

<p><strong>What day of the week do people post most often?</strong> Not the weekend. It seems that many magic aficionados prefer to post on duty (during the work week).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/is-the-magic-cafe-dying/magiccafe-month.png" alt="The Magic Cafe" width="500" /></p>

<p><strong>What month people post most often?</strong> January. After a hectic time with familily or inlaws, spending time staring at yourself practice your classic pass seems to be the best way to relax.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Is The Magic Caf√© declining? Yes. I don‚Äôt know where exactly the magic community has moved to. But, in future work, I hope to contrast other communities‚Äô growth and decline rates to better understand the situation.
   For now, check out The Magic Caf√©, see what is going on. Who knows, maybe it will see a successful resurgence soon.</p>
