I"ë<p>My name is ‚ÄúTony.‚Äù This website serves two significant purposes. First, I am an amateur magician. I have a limited amount of time to practice, perform, and interact with the magic community. Thus, I use this blog to think about magic, refresh my technical skills, and improve my writing.</p>

<p>Second, I am interested in quantifying aspects of both magic and the magic community. What tricks get the best reactions on online platforms? What is the magic communities‚Äô sentiment towards popular performers? Who are the most controversial performers? What tricks get the best reactions online? I am looking to provide numbers to answer some of these questions. I provide the code and data sources for each analysis, but each post will contain my opinions. This blog is NOT an academic paper.</p>

<p><strong>While don‚Äôt you share your real name?</strong></p>

<p>Staying anonymous helps my anxiety.</p>
