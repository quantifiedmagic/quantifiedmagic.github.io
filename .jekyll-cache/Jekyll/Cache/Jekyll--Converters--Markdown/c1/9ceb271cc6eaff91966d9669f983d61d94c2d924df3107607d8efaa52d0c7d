I"ê<p>I am an advid reader of The Magic CafÃ©, with nearly 13 years browsing thousands of threads ranging from â€œHow to Dressâ€ to â€œHow do I improve my Bottom Deal.â€ I also enjoy magic drama and reading fights between users.</p>

<p>Most magicians, amateur or professional, know about The Magic CafÃ©. Steve Brook started The Magic CafÃ© in 2001 to stay in touch with magic friends <a class="citation" href="#endersgame_2020">(EndersGame, 2020)</a>. At the time of this post, it has been online for 20 years, older than Twitter (2006) and Facebook (2004). How has the community changed over time? Is the community still as active as it was a decade ago? I have scraped the public posts to answer these questions and more.</p>

<p>This post introduces the dataset and includes a summary of the basic statistics. In future posts, I will explore the dataset in more depth. If you want to skip the fluff and jump into the dataset yourself, find the dataset and code below:</p>

<p>The most popular subforum on the site is â€œThe workers,â€ a subforum dedicated to card magic. Closly trailing card magic is the subforum on mentalism, titled â€œPenny for your thoughts.â€ The numbers are unsurprising for three reasons. First, online communities do not last for 20 years unless they are active. Second, card magic and mentalism have a special aurora around them with relationships with gambling and simply reading the mind of strangers. Third, this information is accessible by simply summing the numbers available on the site as shown below:</p>

<p>But, what else can we do with the dataset that is not accessible on the websiteâ€™s front page? Below, I answer a few simple questions using the dataset.</p>

<h2 id="which-thread-contains-the-most-posts">Which thread contains the most posts?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œTake any card you like..not THAT one!â€ â€“Every Magician</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Magicians love one liners and hacky premises. This is evident given the ten longest threads listed below:</p>

<p>The longest thread on the forum, â€œAnswer a Question with a Question,â€ has 1,250 pages of content (25k total posts), the post goes on and on and on and on. Go ahead and read each of the popular posts, Iâ€™m sure there are gags there that you already use (I know I do).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-longest-post-made-on-the-magic-cafÃ©">What is the longest post made on The Magic CafÃ©?</h2>

<p>The longest post was made by Lawrence O, with 32 thousand total words. It is a list of references for sponge ball routines. While some effort went into compiling the list, it is the definition of information overload. It is more  useful to either post 3-5 favoriate references, or just link to the references on <a href="https://www.conjuringarchive.com/list/category/340">Conjuring Archive</a>.</p>
